/**
 * The institute name printed on certificates, marksheets and ID cards.
 *
 * It used to be the literal "Ideal Digiskills" in `documentDesigner.ts` and
 * "IDEALDIGISKILLS" in `documents.ts`, so every certificate any institute
 * generated carried our name - including the `{{institute}}` watermark, which
 * could be moved and restyled but never actually renamed.
 *
 * It lives on `branch_settings.siteName`. The PDF builders in `documents.ts`
 * are synchronous and run far from any React tree, so the saved value is also
 * mirrored into localStorage and read from there.
