/**
 * Two gates: signed in at all, then authorised for this particular path.
 *
 * The session is restored asynchronously, so the first render of a hard reload
 * always has `user === null`. Redirecting on that render would bounce a signed-in
 * person to the login screen and then on to their home page — losing the page
 * they actually reloaded. Wait for `loading` to settle first, and remember where
 * they were headed so the login can return them there.
 *
 * The second gate used to be described here but never ran: `canAccess` was
 * exported and called by nothing, and `NotAuthorized` was routed from nowhere,
 * so a student who typed /branch/create got the admin screen. It now renders in
 * place — not a redirect — so the address bar still shows the path that was
 * refused and a reload does not silently land somewhere else.
