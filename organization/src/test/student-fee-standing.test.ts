/**
 * The bug this file covers: a fee collected against a student was invisible.
 *
 * The roster showed one number — the sum of `fee_invoices.totalAmount` — and
 * never what had come in against it. The student's own login was worse: every
 * page read an `amount` field the table does not have (the column is
 * `totalAmount`) and netted it against a `payments` array that was never
 * selected, so a student who had paid in full saw ₹0 billed and ₹0 paid.
