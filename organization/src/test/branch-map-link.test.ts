/**
 * A branch's address, as a link. The written address and the pin on a map are
 * not the same thing -- a lane with no name is found by the shared Google Maps
 * link and by nothing else -- so Create Branch takes one.
 *
 * `branch_addresses.mapLink` arrives with add-branch-map-link.sql, and the form
 * shipped before anyone had to run it. What this file pins down is that a
 * database without the column still gets its branch: the address write goes
 * again without the field rather than failing the whole creation.
