-- RUN ALL — every schema change this application expects, in one file.
--
-- Supabase Dashboard -> SQL Editor, project mbqkkwpiogyopfvlolgf.
-- Paste the whole thing and run once. Safe to re-run: every statement is
-- `if not exists`, `or replace`, or preceded by a `drop ... if exists`.
--
-- Probed against the live database on 2026-09-19.
-- Everything below had already been applied EXCEPT these two columns:
--
--     students.parentage
--     students.maritalStatus
--     batch_timings.classMode / breakStart / breakEnd / colour
--     course_modules  (new table)
--     course_chapters (new table)
--     admission_leads / admission_lead_activities (new tables)
--
-- So in practice PART 1 is the only part that changes anything today. The
-- rest is here so this one file is the whole story, and so a fresh database
-- can be brought up with it.
--
-- What could not be probed from here: the policies and functions in PART 3
-- are checked by the anon key having no way to read `pg_policies`. They are
-- written to be re-runnable, so running them is the safe move either way.

-- PART 1 — MISSING RIGHT NOW
-- =====================================================================

-- How a student is named on their own paperwork, and whether they are married.
--
-- Certificates and marksheets read "Krishna Singh, S/o Ram Singh", and a
-- married woman is named "W/o" rather than "D/o" — which the admission form
-- had no way to record, so every document had to assume one of them.
--
-- `guardianRelation` already exists and means something else: it is the local
-- guardian's relation to the student (Uncle, Aunt, …), not the student's own
-- parentage line.
--
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL editor. Safe to re-run.
alter table public.students
  add column if not exists "parentage" text,

-- ---------- add-batch-timing-schedule.sql ----------
-- What a batch timing is, beyond a start and an end.
--
-- The timetable screen asks four things the table cannot answer: whether the
-- class runs in the room or online, when the break falls inside a long
-- session, and what colour to draw it on the weekly grid so one batch can be
-- picked out from another at a glance.
--
-- The column is `classMode`, not `mode`: PostgREST parses `mode` as the
-- ordered-set aggregate and answers a plain select on it with 42809.
--
-- Notes are deliberately absent: `description` already exists on this table
-- and is exactly that field.
--
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL editor. Safe to re-run. The screen degrades
-- gracefully until it is: timings still read, save and show on the grid,
-- without the mode, the break or the colour.
alter table public.batch_timings
  add column if not exists "classMode" text,
  add column if not exists "breakStart" text,
  add column if not exists "breakEnd" text,
  add column if not exists "colour" text;

-- ---------- course-syllabus.sql ----------
-- Give a course's syllabus somewhere to live.
--
-- A course carries a name, a duration and a fee, and nothing about what is
-- actually taught on it. `courses.syllabus` is a jsonb column that nothing
-- reads or writes -- a single blob cannot be ordered, filtered, or have one
-- chapter edited without rewriting the rest of it, which is why the Syllabus
-- screen needs rows rather than a document.
--
-- Two tables, because that is how a syllabus is read: modules are the sections
-- of the course, and chapters are what is taught inside a section.
--
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL editor. Safe to re-run.


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Modules -- the sections of a course.
--
--    `sortOrder`, not `order`: `order` is reserved in SQL and has to be
--    quoted everywhere it appears, including in every PostgREST query the
--    browser sends.
--
--    Unlike the tables generated from Prisma, `id` and `updatedAt` carry real
--    database defaults, so a PostgREST insert that omits them succeeds.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
create table if not exists public.course_modules (
  id            text primary key default gen_random_uuid()::text,
  "courseId"    text not null references public.courses(id) on delete cascade,
  name          text not null,
  description   text,
  "sortOrder"   integer not null default 1,

);

create index if not exists "course_modules_courseId_idx"
  on public.course_modules ("courseId");


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Chapters -- what is taught inside a module.
--
--    `courseId` is carried here as well as on the module. It is redundant, and
--    it is what lets the screen count a course's chapters and search them
--    without walking every module first; the cascade below keeps the two from
--    drifting apart.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
create table if not exists public.course_chapters (
  id            text primary key default gen_random_uuid()::text,
  "moduleId"    text not null references public.course_modules(id) on delete cascade,
  "courseId"    text not null references public.courses(id) on delete cascade,
  name          text not null,

  -- The practical assignment set against the chapter, kept apart from the
  -- description because it is what the student is asked to do, not read.
  practical     text,
  "pdfUrl"      text,
  "videoUrl"    text,
  "sortOrder"   integer not null default 1,
  status        text not null default 'Active',
  "createdAt"   timestamptz not null default now(),
  "updatedAt"   timestamptz not null default now(),
  "deletedAt"   timestamptz,

create index if not exists "course_chapters_courseId_idx"
  on public.course_chapters ("courseId");


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Who may read and write a syllabus.
--
--    The same line the catalogue itself draws: the organisation owns what is
--    taught, and every account at that institute reads it -- a branch has to
--    see the syllabus of a course it runs, and must not be able to rewrite it.
--
--    Neither table carries an organizationId of its own, so the check goes
--    through the course. SUPER_ADMIN is listed separately for the reason
--    user-management.sql gives: that account often carries no organizationId,
--    and `null = null` is NULL rather than true.

-- =====================================================================

-- was the app's own account table -- it still carries a `password` column
-- from that design -- and the column was constrained to it:
--
--   students_userId_fkey FOREIGN KEY ("userId") REFERENCES "users"("id")
--     ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE
--
-- The organization app has since moved to Supabase auth and touches
-- public.users nowhere at all. The portal resolves a signed-in student
-- through students.userId -> auth.uid(), and create-student-user writes the
-- auth account's id there. That id will never appear in public.users, so the
-- constraint fails every attempt to issue a student login with:
--
--   insert or update on table "students" violates foreign key constraint
--   "students_userId_fkey"
--
-- The constraint cannot simply be repointed at auth.users: students."userId"
-- is TEXT and auth.users.id is uuid, and Postgres will not build a foreign
-- key across incompatible types. So it is dropped rather than replaced.
--
-- What is given up: nothing the app relies on. Postgres will no longer refuse
-- a userId that matches no account. create-student-user already undoes the
-- account it minted if the link fails, and deleting an auth user by hand now
-- leaves a stale id on the student instead of nulling it -- clear it manually
-- if you ever do that.
--
-- What is kept: students_userId_key, the unique index, so two students still
-- cannot share one login.
--
-- public.users itself is left alone. The older backend/ and api-server/
-- services still read it.

-- Give staff logins somewhere to belong.
--
-- The All Users page could only ever list two kinds of account, because those
-- are the only two the schema can place: an organisation names its admin
-- through `organizations.userId`, and a branch names its login through

-- so there was no column anywhere that said which institute they work for --
-- and a login nobody can scope is a login nobody can safely list.
--
-- This adds that column. `organizationId` is the one that matters; `branchId`
-- is set as well when the person works out of a single branch, which is what
-- lets a branch admin see their own staff without seeing head office.
--
-- Both are nullable on purpose. Every row that exists today predates them, and

-- ---------- session-years.sql ----------
-- Give the academic session somewhere to live.
--
-- Session Management looked like a working screen and was not one: both pages
-- held a hardcoded array in React state, so an add, an edit or a delete changed
-- the list on screen, toasted "success", and was gone on the next render. There
-- was no table behind it at all -- `session_years` did not exist, and neither
-- does any session model in the Prisma schema.
--
-- The session is not just a list to maintain. `students.academicYear` is the
-- column an admission writes, and an admission dated outside the session it
-- claims is the kind of wrong that only surfaces a year later when someone runs
-- a report. Storing the session's real start and end dates is what lets the
-- admission form check that.
--
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL editor. Safe to re-run.


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. The table.
--
--    `startDate`/`endDate` are the single source of truth for the year: a
--    separate startYear/endYear pair, which is what the mock form collected,
--    can contradict the dates it sits beside. The years shown on screen are
--    derived from these two columns instead.

--    Unlike the tables generated from Prisma, `id` and `updatedAt` carry real

--

--    but must not be able to move its dates underneath head office.
--
--    SUPER_ADMIN is listed separately for the same reason as in

--    `null = null` is NULL rather than true.

-- ---------- create-student-login.sql ----------
-- =====================================================================
-- Issue a student portal login from the SQL editor
-- =====================================================================
-- A stand-in for the create-student-user edge function, for the case where
-- that function has not been deployed to the project. It mints exactly what
-- the function mints -- an auth account at <loginId>@pushpak.local, the
-- app_metadata claims the portal RLS reads, and the students.userId link --
-- so a login made here and a login made by the function are the same thing to
-- the rest of the app.
--
-- Two things this deliberately does NOT do, and the edge function does:
--
--   * It does not check who is asking. The SQL editor already runs as the
--     database owner, so there is no caller to confine to a branch. Anyone
--     with SQL editor access can already read and write every table; this
--     function hands them nothing they did not have.
--   * It does not make the "Create login" button in View Students work. That
--     button calls the edge function. Until the function is deployed, every
--     login has to be issued by running this.
--
-- Writing into auth.users by hand is not something Supabase supports, so treat
-- this as the temporary path it is and deploy the function when you can:
--   supabase functions deploy create-student-user --project-ref <ref> --workdir organization
--
-- RUN student-portal-rls.sql FIRST. Without it every signed-in account -- a
-- student included -- can read every student's phone, fees and marks.
--
-- Idempotent: re-running against the same student resets their password
-- instead of creating a second account.

--

-- back to the enrolment number, the way the edge function does. The
-- login page appends @pushpak.local, so the account is stored there.
