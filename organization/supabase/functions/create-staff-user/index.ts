 *
 * The two functions beside this one can each mint exactly one role, because
 * each is tied to a thing that owns the login: create-branch-user gives a
 * branch its BRANCH_ADMIN, create-student-user gives a student their portal
 * account. Nobody could create the people who work *at* the institute without
 * being one of those two things, so this function exists for the rest.
 *
 * As with the others, the account is minted here with the service-role key
 * rather than in the browser: signing a new user up client-side would replace
 * the admin's own session, and the browser only holds the anon key.
 *
 * Unlike the others it also writes the `users` row. Nothing else in the app
 * ever inserted into that table, which is why the All Users page had nothing
 * to list — Supabase Auth held the account and `public.users` never heard
 * about it. Both are written here so the two cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Called from the Add User dialog on the All Users page, via
 * supabase.functions.invoke().
